Given a non-empty array of integers, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.

Note:

Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using extra memory?

class Solution:
    def singleNumber(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        for num in nums[1:]:
            nums[0] ^= num 
        return nums[0]
